\title{Matching Raw P-Values with Supports}
\usage{
match.pvals(pCDFlist, raw.pvalues, pCDFlist.indices = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{pCDFlist}{list of the supports of the CDFs of the p-values; each list item must be a numeric vector, which is sorted in increasing order and whose last element equals 1.}

\item{raw.pvalues}{numeric vector with raw p-values for which a discrete FDR procedure is to be performed.}

\item{pCDFlist.indices}{list of numeric vectors containing the test indices that indicate to which raw p-value each \strong{unique} support in \code{pCDFlist} belongs; ignored if the lengths of \code{test.results} and \code{pCDFlist} are equal.}
}
\value{
A vector where each raw p-value has been replaced by its nearest neighbor, if
necessary.
}
\description{
\ifelse{html}{\href{https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html#deprecated}{\figure{lifecycle-deprecated.svg}{options: alt='[Deprecated]'}}}{\strong{[Deprecated]}}

Constructs the observed p-values from the raw observed p-values, by rounding
them to their nearest neighbor matching with the supports of their
respective CDFs (as in function \code{p.discrete.adjust()} of package
\code{discreteMTP}, which is no longer available on CRAN).

\strong{Note}: In the next version, this is to become an internal function and
will have to be called directly via \code{:::}, i.e.
\code{DiscreteFDR:::match.pvals()}.
}
\details{
Well computed raw p-values should already belong to their respective CDF
support. So this function is called at the beginning of \code{\link[=discrete.BH]{discrete.BH()}},
\code{\link[=DBH]{DBH()}}, \code{\link[=ADBH]{ADBH()}} and \code{\link[=DBR]{DBR()}}, just in case raw p-values are biased.

For each raw p-value that needs to be rounded, a warning is issued.

toyRaw2 <- c(0.31,0.6)
