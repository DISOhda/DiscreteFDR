Description: Implementations of the multiple testing procedures for discrete
    tests described in the paper Döhler, Durand and Roquain (2018) "New FDR
    bounds for discrete and heterogeneous tests" <doi:10.1214/18-EJS1441>. The
    main procedures of the paper (HSU and HSD), their adaptive counterparts
    (AHSU and AHSD), and the HBR variant are available and are coded to take as
    input the results of a test procedure from package "DiscreteTests", or a set
    of observed p-values and their discrete support under their nulls. A
    shortcut function to obtain such p-values and supports is also provided,
    along with a wrapper allowing to apply discrete procedures directly to data.
