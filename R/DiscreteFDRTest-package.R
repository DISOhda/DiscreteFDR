#' @description
#' This package implements the \[HSU\], \[HSD\],
#' \[AHSU\], \[AHSD\] and \[HBR-\eqn{\lambda}\] procedures for
#' discrete tests (see References).

#' @details
#' The functions are reorganized from the reference paper in the following way.
#' [discrete.BH] (for Discrete Benjamini-Hochberg) implements
#' \[HSU\], \[HSD\], \[AHSU\] and \[AHSD\], while [DBR] (for Discrete 
#' Blanchard-Roquain) implements \[HBR-\eqn{\lambda}\]. [DBH] and [ADBH] are
#' wrapper functions for [discrete.BH] to access \[HSU\] and \[HSD\], as well as
#' \[AHSU\] and \[AHSD\] directly. Their main arguments are a vector of raw
#' observed p-values, and a list of the same length, whose elements are the
#' discrete supports of the CDFs of the p-values.
#' 
#' The function [fisher.pvalues.support] allows to compute such p-values and
#' support in the framework of a Fisher's exact test of association. It has been
#' inspired by a help page of the package `discreteMTP`, which is no longer
#' available on CRAN.
#' 
#' The function [fast.Discrete] is a wrapper for [fisher.pvalues.support] and
#' [discrete.BH] which allows to apply discrete procedures directly to a data
#' set of contingency tables.
#' 
#' We also provide the `amnesia` data set, used in our examples and in our
#' paper. It is basically the `amnesia` data set of package `discreteMTP` (no
#' longer on CRAN), but slightly reformatted.
#' 
#' No other function of the package should be used directly, as they are only
#' internal functions called by the main ones.
